  "summary": "My name is Miguel Carvalho, a Frontend Engineer from Portugal with a soft spot for minimal architecture, clean design, and software that empowers people.\n\nOver the past decade I have reinvented my career, founded a SaaS startup for logistics teams, helped Bright Pixel scale \"StayUps\", and shipped global translations at Unbabel. Since 2020 I have gone fully independent - designing Munii's next-gen banking UX, accelerating Parkinson's research with ASAP, creating Around's hybrid-meeting experience, and crafting Sedition's digital art platform.\n\nToday I lead frontend innovation at Eleos, pairing thoughtful design with dependable execution so the product feels as good as it performs.",
